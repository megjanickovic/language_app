# language_app
 
This is something I'm making to learn how to use Python and Flask. I'm using MySQL for the database. I'm also using Bootstrap for the styling.

I'm studying Japanese and wanted a way that I could practice vocab, go over my notes, etc all in one place. 

Right now, you can enter words to create your own custom dictionary for the words you've learned in that language. You can add multiple languages as well. You can study your word list with flashcards. You can also create your own tags, and tag words to customize what you want to study. For example, you might want to study only chapters 4 and 5, or maybe you just want to practice verbs. 

The next feature I'm going to add is a way to add notes.
